// === Predictions === 
// I think the most screen time will either be on my only day off both my jobs which is sunday but it might be saturday since I dont have to sleep in early. 
// - Most of my screentime consists of reading ebooks, podcasts and not much social media. So I do believe I will have alot of screentime throughoutthe week
// My best focus day might be between Monday or thursday 
// I dont keep track of my caffeine intake, I usally refil my 40 oz tumbler at work with Coke zero but its mostly just ice so after a few sips I need a refill, 
// - but for this assingment purpose ill say each refill is a cup. At home at most ill have a green tea or a 20oz coke zero
