### Were your predictions right?

Some of my predictions were accurate. I guessed that Sunday or Saturday would have the most screen time, and Saturday did. I also thought my focus would be highest earlier in the week, which was mostly true — Monday and Sunday had the top focus levels. My caffeine guess was harder to confirm, but it tracked close to my habits.

### What surprised you?

In terms of my schedule I was surprised that even on days with more sleep, my focus didn’t always go up. Also, despite my screen time being higher on the weekend, I couldnt find a good corelation between it to my mood or sleep. 

### What was tricky or rewarding?

The tricky part was making sure all the functions worked correctly and reading the data cleanly in the output. But once it all worked, it was rewarding to actually see patterns in my own habits and understand how code could help analyze real life.

### How did using your own data change things?

Using my own data made the project feel way more personal and a bit fun, I wasn’t just working with given numbers, I actually had to get the numbers myself and I could actually relate to what I was seeing in the output. It gave the assingment and output more attachmnent and importance.
